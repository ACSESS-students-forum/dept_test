#Web Development Module Collection
This repository contains a collection of small, modular web development components that can be combined to build a complete website. Each task should take approximately 3-6 hours to complete and focuses on a specific functionality or UI element.

Include all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript within this single file
Place CSS in a <style> tag in the <head> section
Place JavaScript in a <script> tag before the closing </body> tag
For commit messages and descriptions:
Commit message: Include your name and task code (e.g., "John Smith - HC001")
Commit description: Detailed explanation of what changes you made and any challenges you faced
